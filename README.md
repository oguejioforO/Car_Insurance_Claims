# Car_Insurance_Claims Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project explores patterns in car insurance claims to uncover key factors that influence claim frequency and claim amount.
Using a combination of Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, I examine the relationship between customer demographics, 
car attributes, and claim behavior to support data-driven decision-making for insurance businesses.

### Data Source

Dataset: Car Insurance Dataset

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset includes customer information such as birthdate, gender, marital status, household income, car usage, car details, and insurance claim history.

### Tools
- Python (pandas) – Data cleaning and initial exploration

- Excel – Quick data validation [Download here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10J4LRwRY9WbXMomV_Xz2nACQ5iOzyCGTtYKg1QiRvDs/edit?usp=sharing)

- Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization

### Data Cleaning
Performed using Python (Power_BI):

Derived new columns such as:

- Income Category by binning household_income

- Standardized categorical variables (e.g., merged similar education levels, ensured consistency in car color and marital status)

- Ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for analysis in Power BI

### Exploratory Analysis
Key questions explored:

1. What is the distribution of car usage across gender and kids driving?
2. Which car makes/models are most involved in claims, and what are the average claim amounts?
3. Is there a correlation between education and claim behavior?
4. How does car color affect claim frequency and amount?
5. What are the differences in claim amounts across coverage zones?
6. How does household income relate to claim frequency and value?

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. Claim Frequency & Car Usage: Private car users file more claims than commercial users.
2. Marital Status & Claims: Single and married individuals tend to file more claims.
3. Coverage Zone Impact: Urban and highly urban areas report higher claim amounts.
4. Household Income: Higher-income groups tend to have slightly higher claim amounts.
5. Car Year Trends: 2006–2010 car models had more claim activity.
6. Education Impact: Bachelor's and Master's holders show higher average claim amounts.

### Recommendations
These are the recommendation based on the analysis:
- Zone-Based Pricing: Adjust insurance premiums based on regional risk levels
- Model-Specific Risk: Pay closer attention to newer car models when pricing
- Customer Segmentation: Develop tailored plans for high-income or highly educated segments
- Marital-Based Risk Management: Explore marketing strategies for single/married individuals

### Limitations
- The dataset is static and may not reflect real-time trends or recent changes in insurance behavior.
- The analysis is based on the available features and may not capture all factors influencing insurance claims.
